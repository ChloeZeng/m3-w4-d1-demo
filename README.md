Week3-day2 Homework
Through this exercise, I learned how to use core Sass features such as variables, nesting, mixins, and imports to write cleaner and more maintainable styles. I also practiced compiling SCSS into CSS and saw how Flexbox can be used to center content precisely. Overall, this assignment helped me understand how Sass improves workflow and structure in modern styling.
